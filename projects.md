  <li><a href="http://chatfly.xyz">ChatFly</a> - A temporary chat room site where you can create a random chat room that will dissapear on a date that you set. Built with Node, Socket.io, Handlebars, MongoDB jQuery and CoffeeScript. I deployed it to Digital Ocean and used Vagrant to deal with all of my setup, as well as have my local setup be the same as my server setup. That saved me a lot of headaches and I'm going to use Vagrant for projects going forward.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ec2-52-88-144-76.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/">Move Recommender</a> - I wanted to practice some of what I learned from two recent Spark/Machine Learning courses, so I built a movie recommendation site based using the Movie Lense dataset. I used cosine similarity to determine the most similar users and recommended movies based on that. Spark was used to process the data, and Python/Flask to serve the site. Check out the about page for more details.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/camlinke/pocket-to-pinboard">Pocket to Pinboard</a> - Takes the articles and tags you have saved in Pocket and imports them to Pinboard. Written in Python.</li>
