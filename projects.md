<ul class="frontpage-list descriptive">
  <li><a href="#">Move Recommender</a> - I wanted to practice some of what I learned from two recent Spark/Machine Learning courses, so I built a movie recommendation site based using the Movie Lense dataset. I used cosine similarity to determine the most similar users and recommended movies based on that. Spark was used to process the data, and Python/Flask to serve the site. Check out the about page for more details... (link coming soon)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/camlinke/pocket-to-pinboard">Pocket to Pinboard</a> - Takes the articles and tags you have saved in Pocket and imports them to Pinboard. Written in Python.</li>
