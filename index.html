  Cam is a software entrepreneur and product manager. In the past few years, he has worked to grow Edmonton's emerging creative and tech economy by connecting entrepreneurs, investors, developers and creative minds through Startup Edmonton, an organization he co-founded in 2009. In addition, Cam formed DemoCamp Edmonton in 2008 as a forum to bring the Edmonton tech community together, which he continues to lead along with his work at Startup Edmonton and Flightpath Ventures, an angel-stage fund investing in software startups. Prior to immersing himself in community building, he was the Product Manager at Nexopia.com and also currently leads Touch Metric, a maker of in-person survey software. In recognition of his work in Edmonton's tech and startup community, he was named one of Avenue Magazine's 2011 Top 40 Under 40.

<h3>Work</h3>
<p><a href="http://startupedmonton.com">Startup Edmonton</a> - In 2009 I founded Startup Edmonton with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenbautista">Ken Bautista</a> to help build the startup community in Edmonton. What started as a side project for us has grown into a full fledged non-profit with 14,000 sq/ft of space in downtown Edmonton, hundreds of events, meetups, hackathons, and an incredible growing community and thriving startup ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="http://flightpathventures.com">Flightpath Ventures</a> - Flightpath Ventures is an angel stage fund based in Edmonton. We invest in software/internet companies and work to help them grow from initial prototype to traction and funding.</p>
<p><a href="http://touchmetric.com">Touch Metric</a> - Touch Metric makes in-person survey software. While most face to face surveys still get recorded using a clipboard our app, Surveyor, allows information to be collected on an iOS device giving customers instant access to their digitized data. We've been used by clients all over the world ranging from door-knocking in political campaigns, to intercept surveys in Fortune 500 retail stores.</p>
<p><a href="http://aicml.ca">AICML</a> - Recently I invited to join the board of the Alberta Ingenuity Centre for Machine Learning (AICML). A world renowned centre, with an incredible team of researches and students, I'm excited to join the board and help out however I can.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<ul class="frontpage-list descriptive">
  <li><a href="http://chatfly.xyz">ChatFly</a> - A temporary chat room site where you can create a random chat room that will dissapear on a date that you set. Built with Node, Socket.io, Handlebars, MongoDB jQuery and CoffeeScript. I deployed it to Digital Ocean and used Vagrant to deal with all of my setup, as well as have my local setup be the same as my server setup. That saved me a lot of headaches and I'm going to use Vagrant for projects going forward.</li>
  <li><a href="http://ec2-52-88-144-76.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/">Move Recommender</a> - I wanted to practice some of what I learned from two recent Spark/Machine Learning courses, so I built a movie recommendation site based using the Movie Lense dataset. I used cosine similarity to determine the most similar users and recommended movies based on that. Spark was used to process the data, Python/Flask to serve the site, also used a Redis job queue, and Postgres for user data. Check out the about page for more details.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/camlinke/pocket-to-pinboard">Pocket to Pinboard</a> - Takes the articles and tags you have saved in Pocket and imports them to Pinboard. Written in Python.</li>
